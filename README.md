Logic gates are fundamental building blocks of digital circuits and play a crucial role in the field of digital electronics. These gates perform basic logical operations on binary inputs (0s and 1s) and produce binary outputs based on predefined rules. By combining different logic gates, complex digital circuits can be designed to perform a variety of tasks due to every logic gate has their own characteristics.

<summary>Overview:</summary>
 Combinational logic circuits are digital circuits where the output is solely determined by the current combination of input values. These circuits do not have any form of memory or feedback; the output depends only on the instantaneous input conditions. Combinational logic circuits perform specific Boolean functions or logical operations and are constructed using basic logic gates.

<summary>Overview:</summary>
A shift register is a digital circuit that is capable of shifting its stored binary data in one or both directions, left or right. It consists of a chain of flip-flops, where each flip-flop holds a single bit of data. The shifting operation involves moving the bits along the register in response to clock pulses or other control signals.
