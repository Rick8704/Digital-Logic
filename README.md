 <summary><h2> Chapter 5: Combinational Logic Circuit
   <p> </p>
   </h2></summary>
<summary>Overview:</summary>
 Combinational logic circuits are digital circuits where the output is solely determined by the current combination of input values. These circuits do not have any form of memory or feedback; the output depends only on the instantaneous input conditions. Combinational logic circuits perform specific Boolean functions or logical operations and are constructed using basic logic gates.

 <summary><h2> Chapter 9: Shift Register
   <p> <img align="left" width="50%"  /></p>
   </h2></summary>
<summary>Overview:</summary>
A shift register is a digital circuit that is capable of shifting its stored binary data in one or both directions, left or right. It consists of a chain of flip-flops, where each flip-flop holds a single bit of data. The shifting operation involves moving the bits along the register in response to clock pulses or other control signals.
